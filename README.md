# Introduction
This guide instructs users on how to replace a 39100-TBA-A41 Radio using a radio from another vehicle. This can be a cost-effective alternative to purchasing a new radio directly from the dealership. You DO NOT need to purchase a new radio 
directly from Honda or Panasonic

# Diagnosis
If you have installed a replacement 39100-TBA-A41 radio in your 2019 Honda Civic (or similar model) and encounter an issue where the radio makes three short beeps or chirps when you try to turn it on, this indicates that the anti-theft or anti-tampering system is likely active. The main display unit might not show an error message or explicitly state that the radio is locked, leading to confusion. This is a common Honda radio problem after a swap or battery disconnection.

# Steps to Retrieve Radio Code and Unlock Your Honda Radio
1. Acquire a used 39100-TBA-A41 radio from a reliable reseller or a scrapyard.
2. Install the 39100-TBA-A41 radio.
   - Finding an online resource for installation is recommended, as this is outside the scope of this guide.
3. Retrieve the radio's serial number. See [Honda's official guide](https://mygarage.honda.com/s/serial-number-help#:~:text=The%20Radio%2FNavigation%20Code%20and,at%20the%20time%20of%20delivery) for assistance.
   1. Power on the vehicle.
   2. Press the following buttons in *sequence*: 1, then 6, then Power (left knob).
   3. The device display should show a "Version / System" screen with the "Serial number display". Record this 8-digit code.
4. Retrieve the Radio Code from [Honda's Radio/Nav Code website](https://mygarage.honda.com/s/radio-nav-code?brand=Honda).
   1. Enter the 8-digit serial number you retrieved in the previous step.
   2. Record the 5-digit Radio Code (also known as the security code). This code should consist of digits 1-6.
5. Enter the Radio Code into the 39100-TBA-A41 radio to disable the anti-theft lock.
   1. Power on the vehicle.
   2. Press the following buttons in *sequence*: 1, then 5, then Select (right knob).

# Notes: Resetting Radio After Failed Code Entry Attempts
If you enter the wrong code too many times and lock yourself out, you can reset the system by disconnecting the vehicle's battery for approximately 30 minutes to an hour. This should clear the locked state and allow you to try entering the radio unlock code again.
